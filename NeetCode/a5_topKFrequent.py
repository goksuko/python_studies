print(sol.topKFrequent([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3,4 ,4 ,4 ,4, 5], 2))  # Expected output: [1, 2]

# Top K Elements in List
# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.

# The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.

# You may return the output in any order.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2

# Output: [2,3]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1

# Output: [7]
# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4.
# -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# 1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums.

# Recommended Time & Space Complexity
# You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.


# Hint 1
# A naive solution would be to count the frequency of each number and then sort the array based on each elementâ€™s frequency. After that, we would select the top k frequent elements. This would be an O(nlogn) solution. Though this solution is acceptable, can you think of a better way?


# Hint 2
# Can you think of an algorithm which involves grouping numbers based on their frequency?


# Hint 3
# Use the bucket sort algorithm to create n buckets, grouping numbers based on their frequencies from 1 to n. Then, pick the top k numbers from the buckets, starting from n down to 1.
