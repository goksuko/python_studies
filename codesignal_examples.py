# The nature of the GCA means that there is significantly more uniformity in the questions you’ll get compared to the other test types. For the 70-minute test, you’ll get 4 questions.

# Q1 and Q2 are gimmes and should be crushed as soon as possible.

# Q3 is usually an implementation-heavy LeetCode Medium problem and from experience is usually a 2-D matrix problem that is very bashing-friendly. What this means is there isn’t much in the way of algorithmic complexities to bother with – the solution is long, but you simply need to do what it asks you to do without worrying about time complexity and such.

# LeetCode questions that approximate a CodeSignal Q3

# https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-local-values-in-a-matrix/
# https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-matrix/
# https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification - this is on the harder side but is a good example of a string-based implementation problem for Q3
# Aim to get them in 15-20 minutes or so.

# Q4 is a purely algorithmic LeetCode Medium problem – here you will need to focus on making sure that the time complexity is optimal. From experience Q4 normally involves a clever application of hashmaps and it is expected that you know how to work with it properly inside and out. While greedy problems are technically possible, DP (dynamic programming) questions will not show up in Q4 (and this test).
